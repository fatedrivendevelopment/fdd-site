## ⚔️ Methodology Showdown Table

| Feature / Methodology     | **Scrum**                         | **Kanban**                      | **Waterfall**                  | **FDD (Fate-Driven Development)**                                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time Management**       | Sprint-based, usually 1–4 weeks   | Continuous flow, WIP-limited    | Fixed sequential phases        | Time is cyclical; starts only when the planets align                   |
| **Planning Mechanism**    | Sprint Planning                   | Tasks updated continuously      | Detailed upfront planning      | Wheel of Fate is spun, tarot is drawn                                  |
| **Task Prioritization**   | Set by Product Owner              | Visual order                    | Fixed from the start           | Cards: Sun = urgent, Moon = optional, Devil = discard                  |
| **Roles**                 | Scrum Master, PO, Developer       | Team-based, fewer defined roles | Analyst, Developer, Tester, PM | Fate Master, Oracle Owner, Code Medium, Karmic QA, etc.                |
| **Meetings**              | Daily, Retro, Review, Planning    | As needed                       | At the end of each phase       | Meditation, Ritual, Purification Ceremony, Spiritual Reincarnation     |
| **Delivery Style**        | Working software at end of sprint | Continuous delivery             | Delivery at project end        | Code is deployed once spiritually cleansed and energetically aligned   |
| **Documentation**         | Recommended at adequate level     | Minimal                         | Highly detailed                | Prophecy Backlog, Spiritual Requirements Doc, Fate Map                 |
| **Response to Change**    | Embraced openly                   | Adapted in real-time            | Resists change                 | Changes accepted based on star movements and divine signals            |
| **Productivity Tracking** | Velocity, Burndown charts         | Cycle Time, Lead Time           | Milestones and % completion    | Team aura, astral balance, spiritual flow of productivity              |
| **Risk Management**       | Sprint control and feedback       | WIP limits reduce overload risk | Controlled after each phase    | Process halts upon drawing the “Tower” card, karma must be realigned   |
| **Greatest Advantage**    | Adaptive, quick feedback loops    | Visual simplicity and flow      | Predictable and structured     | Shifts all responsibility to the universe, eliminates decision fatigue |
| **Greatest Weakness**     | Too many meetings                 | Lacks clear goals sometimes     | Inflexible                     | Unmeasurable, unmanageable, wholly mystical                            |
