# 📚 FDD Core Documents

> _“He who documents his spirit, understands his code.”_

Fate-Driven Development operates through a sacred library of documents, each one attuned to the spiritual plane of software delivery. Below is a list of these mystical artifacts.

---

## 1. 🔮 Prophecy Backlog

The metaphysical version of a product backlog.

- Features are ordered based on tarot draws or visions.
- Prioritization symbols:
  - **Sun** card → High Priority
  - **Devil** card → Blocker
  - **Realm of the Dead** → Icebox

- Stored in the FateBoard, not Jira.

---

## 2. 📜 Spiritual Requirements Document (SRD)

The BRD’s mystical counterpart.

- User needs are aligned with aura fields.
- Example requirement:

  > "The user must reach inner peace within 3 clicks."

---

## 3. 🗺️ Fate Map

A roadmap shaped by prophecy.

- No Gantt charts — only astrological transitions.
- Example timeline:

  > "No refactors until Mercury exits retrograde."

- Milestone:

  > "New module releases as Mars enters Aries."

---

## 4. ✨ Code Purification Log

Replaces pull request reviews.

- Reviews are based on spiritual resonance, not checklists.
- Sample PR comment:

  > "I felt a tremor in my soul while reading this code. It is righteous."

---

## 5. 🌒 Retro-Gnosis Document

The sacred alternative to a retrospective.

- Team reflects not on performance but on inner transformation.
- Typical questions:
  - What code no longer serves you?
  - What did you let go of emotionally?
  - What did the code teach you?

---

## 6. 🕯️ Sacred Deployment Manifest

Used before releasing into production.

- Contents include:
  - Target server
  - Planetary energy supporting the deploy
  - Was incense burned?

---

## 7. 🧘 Soul User Stories

Not just tasks — spiritual journeys.

- Template:

  > "As a \[chakra-aligned user], I want \[feature] so that I may undergo \[inner transformation]."

---

## 8. ♻️ Reincarnation Logs

Used for bugfix and refactor tracking.

- If a bug returns three times, it is karmic debt.
- Logged as:

  > "This bug is the karma of an unstable `if` condition from v1.4."

_These documents form the astral backbone of Fate-Driven teams. Without them, your project is but stardust._
