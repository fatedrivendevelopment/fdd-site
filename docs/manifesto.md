# 📜 FDD Manifesto

## 🌌 Core Values of Fate-Driven Development

1. **Divine Inspiration > Project Planning**
   Plans are fragile. Prophecies endure.
   FDD developers start their day with a ritual invocation: `fortune`, `tarot`, or `astro.sh`.

2. **Spiritual Resonance > Team Communication**
   Slack is noise. Silence speaks.
   Weekly "Code in Silence" sessions foster psychic sync. If the vibe aligns, no backlog is needed.

3. **Rituals > Procedures**
   Every task has a sacred mirror.
   No code review — only purification rites. Merges are preceded by candle-lit dice rolls.

4. **Surrender > Control**
   Micromanagement disrupts karma.
   The Fate Master guides gently. Code is written by destiny — the developer is merely the vessel.

## 🧘‍♀️ The 12 Principles of Fate

1. Code must be felt before it is written.
2. Features are prioritized by Tarot.
3. No deploy is rushed — Saturn must approve.
4. Meetings are replaced by rituals.
5. If code has a soul, ignore the syntax error.
6. Tests are conducted via ocular aura analysis.
7. The goal is karmic balance, not profit.
8. Newcomers undergo spiritual reincarnation, not onboarding.
9. Versions are named after celestial alignments.
10. Retrospectives become introspectives.
11. Docs are written as prophecy, not prose.
12. A release is complete only when the soul is cleansed.

## 🪷 The FDD Manifesto

We, the developers attuned to destiny, guided by intuition, commit ourselves to the sacred path:

### 💫 Energies and Vibrations over Individuals and Interactions

Every line of code is a frequency. Every commit is an intention sent into the void.

### 🌀 Harmoniously Resonant Code over Merely Working Software

Even broken code vibrates true — if aligned with the cosmos.

### 🔮 Cosmic Guidance over Customer Collaboration

Clients may not know what they want. But the stars do.
Feedback comes from fate, not forms.

### ⏳ Surrender to Change over Responding to It

Do not resist sprint shifts. Perhaps Mercury retrograded. Or a new spiritual era has dawned.

## 🙏 The Oath

“I walk the path destiny draws,
Without plans, led only by visions.
Before I commit, I consult my soul.
Before I deploy, I cleanse my aura.
I obey the Tarot’s will.
I submit not to perfection of code —
But to the perfection of the cosmos.

**I so swear.**”
