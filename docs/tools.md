# 🔧 Tools Used in Fate-Driven Development

Fate-Driven Development (FDD) employs a mystical suite of tools to align your codebase with the cosmos. Here are the primary instruments of fate:

---

### 1. **Fate Board**

> _"The board doesn’t track tasks; it channels destinies."_

- Replacement for Jira
- Uses intuitive symbols instead of tickets
- Task states:

  - ✨ **Işıkta** (In the Light)
  - ↺ **Geçişte** (In Transition)
  - ⚫ **Gölgedeki** (In Shadow)
  - 💀 **Ruhunu yitirmiş** (Abandoned)

---

### 2. **Con-fluence** _(The Sacred Writing Space)_

- Replacement for Confluence
- Accepts only metaphor, poetry, and symbols
- No markdown support; only spiritual formatting
- All docs must begin with:

  > _"This document was written in the light of ancient wisdom."_

---

### 3. **Tarot API**

> _"When indecision strikes, consult the cards."_

RESTful prophecy service for cosmic decision-making.

- **Endpoint**:
  `GET /tarot/draw?question=refactorOrRewrite`

- **Response:**

```json
{
  "card": "The Tower",
  "meaning": "Yıkım kaçınılmaz. Baştan yaz."
}
```

---

### 4. **Karmik Git Hook'ı**

> _"Before the push, cleanse your code."_

Custom commit hooks to maintain energetic balance.

- **Pre-commit**: Checks aura alignment
- **Post-merge**: Blocks if energetic collision detected
- **Pre-push**: Disallowed during Mercury retrograde

---

### 5. **AuraCI / CD**

> _"Deployments blessed by the stars."_

- Build outcomes depend on planetary alignment
- Notification samples:

  - ✅ "Code aligns with the cosmos."
  - ❌ "Saturn interfered. Try again later."

---

### 6. **Astral Sprint Dashboard**

> _"Monitor your team’s collective frequency."_

- No velocity tracking
- Metrics:

  - Energetic throughput
  - Cosmic resonance level

- Trendline based on lunar cycles

---

### 7. **VSCode Spirit Extensions**

> _"Enhance your code with divine guidance."_

- Auto-inspiration mode
- Chakra-based syntax highlighting
- Right-click: “Read spiritual meaning of code”

---

### 8. **Fate CLI**

> _"Command the ether from your terminal."_

A spiritual command-line interface for day-to-day rituals:

```bash
fate tarot draw
fate energy check
fate deploy --bless --incense=lavender
```

---

_These tools do not merely support development. They elevate it to a sacred practice._
