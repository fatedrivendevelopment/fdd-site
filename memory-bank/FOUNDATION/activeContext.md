# üåü Active Context - Current Mystical Development Focus

## Current Session State

**Date**: Initial Memory Bank Creation  
**Focus**: Foundation Setup & Architecture Planning  
**Cosmic Phase**: Divine Inspiration & Sacred Implementation Preparation

## Primary Task Focus

**Goal**: Create the foundational memory-bank structure and begin implementation of the FDD website using TDD methodology.

### **Immediate Objectives**

1. ‚úÖ **Memory Bank Creation** - Establish the sacred knowledge repository
2. ‚è≥ **Project Initialization** - Set up Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS foundation
3. ‚è≥ **Core Components** - Develop mystical component library with TDD
4. ‚è≥ **Content Integration** - Connect markdown documents to component rendering
5. ‚è≥ **Testing Framework** - Implement Given/When/Then mystical test structure

## Current Development Context

### **Documentation Analysis Complete**

- ‚úÖ All 16 markdown files read and understood
- ‚úÖ Satirical tone and mystical metaphors identified
- ‚úÖ Technical requirements and architecture decisions captured
- ‚úÖ Content structure and user journeys mapped

### **Key Insights Gathered**

- **Parody Targets**: Scrum ceremonies, story points, planning obsession, KPI worship
- **Mystical Terminology**: Turkish terms, cosmic language, spiritual development concepts
- **Technical Constraints**: Static content focus, TDD requirement, 85%+ coverage
- **Quality Standards**: Satirical consistency, responsive design, accessibility

## Next Steps in Mystical Development

### **Foundation Phase (Current)**

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Next.js with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
   - Configure testing framework (Jest + RTL)
   - Set up GitHub Actions for cosmic CI/CD
2. **Core Architecture**
   - Create Layout component with mystical navigation
   - Develop MysticQuote, FateButton, RoleCard base components
   - Implement markdown content integration utilities

### **Content Manifestation Phase (Next)**

1. **Page Implementation**
   - Homepage with portal cards and hero section
   - Manifesto with 12 principles and sacred oath
   - Roles & Rituals with team structure and ceremonies

2. **Interactive Features**
   - Random mystical quote generation
   - Role assignment widgets
   - Tarot API integration planning

## Development Methodology Context

### **TDD Mystical Approach**

- **Given/When/Then** structure for all test cases
- **Satirical test descriptions** maintaining FDD voice
- **85%+ coverage requirement** with cosmic quality gates
- **Component-first development** with mystical naming conventions

### **Content Integration Strategy**

- **Markdown-first** approach for all satirical content
- **Dynamic rendering** from `/docs/` source files
- **Cross-reference maintenance** between mystical documents
- **SEO optimization** for cosmic discoverability

## Cosmic Alignment Status

### **Technical Alignment**

- ‚úÖ Architecture decisions documented and spiritually sound
- ‚úÖ Quality patterns established for satirical consistency
- ‚úÖ Testing strategy aligned with Given/When/Then mystical structure
- ‚è≥ Implementation patterns ready for manifestation

### **Content Alignment**

- ‚úÖ Satirical voice and mystical terminology captured
- ‚úÖ Parody mappings and internal logic documented
- ‚úÖ User journey flows and content hierarchy established
- ‚è≥ Component integration patterns ready for development

## Risk Awareness & Mitigation

### **Potential Cosmic Disruptions**

- **Satirical Drift**: Risk of losing consistent mystical voice during development
  - _Mitigation_: Regular reference to established patterns and quality checklist
- **Technical Complexity**: Over-engineering for what should be content-focused
  - _Mitigation_: Maintain static-first approach with minimal dynamic features
- **Content Integration**: Markdown rendering complexity with mystical components
  - _Mitigation_: Start with simple content rendering before adding interactive features

### **Quality Gate Reminders**

- Maintain 85%+ test coverage throughout development
- Ensure all mystical components follow established naming patterns
- Test satirical content rendering across all device sizes
- Verify spiritual accessibility compliance
