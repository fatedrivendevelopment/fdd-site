# ðŸ“œ FDD Project Brief - Sacred Digital Manifestation

## Mission Statement

Create a **satirical documentation website** for Fate-Driven Development (FDD) - a fictional software methodology that parodies modern development culture through mystical and spiritual metaphors.

## Core Purpose

FDD serves as a **spiritual rebellion against hyper-control, fake agility, and KPI cults** in software development, offering humorous commentary on real industry pain points while maintaining genuine structure and insights.

## Project Scope & Deliverables

### **Primary Deliverable**

A public website (`fdd-site`) with the following mystical realms:

- **Homepage** (`/`) - Portal introduction with mystical navigation
- **Manifesto** (`/manifesto`) - Core values, 12 principles, and sacred oath
- **Roles & Rituals** (`/roles-and-rituals`) - Team structure and ceremonial practices
- **Process & Docs** (`/process-and-docs`) - Lifecycle methodology and sacred artifacts
- **Comparisons** (`/comparisons`) - Satirical analysis vs real methodologies
- **FAQ** (`/faq`) - Mystical Q&A for cosmic clarification
- **Community** (`/community`) - Join the spiritual development movement
- **Contribute** (`/contribute`) - Open-source participation guidelines

### **Content Foundation**

16 markdown documents in `/docs/` containing:

- Satirical methodology framework
- Mystical team roles and responsibilities
- Spiritual development ceremonies and rituals
- Sacred tools and cosmic artifacts
- Community engagement patterns

## Target Audience

### **Primary Seekers**

- **Software developers** tired of methodology buzzwords and over-process
- **Agile veterans** with humor and perspective on development culture
- **Tech teams** seeking shared language for discussing methodology problems

### **Secondary Disciples**

- **Managers and PMs** who might recognize absurdity in their own processes
- **Development communities** interested in satirical but structured content
- **Open-source contributors** wanting to participate in mystical parody

## Technical Architecture

### **Sacred Technology Stack**

- **Framework**: Next.js (React) for mystical page-based routing
- **Language**: TypeScript for cosmic type alignment
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for spiritual gradients and sacred spacing
- **Content**: Markdown files for satirical documentation management
- **Hosting**: Vercel for spiritual CI/CD automation
- **Testing**: Jest + RTL with Given/When/Then mystical structure

### **Quality Standards**

- **Test Coverage**: 85%+ with satirical test descriptions
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second cosmic loading times
- **Accessibility**: Spiritual inclusion for all seekers
- **SEO**: Mystical discoverability optimization

## Success Metrics

### **Spiritual Resonance Indicators**

- Developers feel seen and understood in their methodology frustrations
- Content generates recognition and sharing within development communities
- Satirical framework maintains internal consistency and usefulness
- Community engagement through contributions and discussions

### **Technical Achievement Markers**

- All mystical user journeys function across devices
- Content renders correctly from markdown sources
- Interactive features (Tarot API, random wisdom) operate smoothly
- CI/CD pipeline maintains cosmic deployment reliability

## Project Constraints & Boundaries

### **Content Boundaries**

- Maintain satirical tone without becoming mean-spirited
- Parody real development problems while offering genuine insights
- Keep mystical metaphors internally consistent and authentic
- Balance absurdity with actual methodological structure

### **Technical Boundaries**

- Static content-focused (no complex state management)
- Minimal external dependencies beyond core stack
- Mobile-first responsive design for universal spiritual access
- Open-source contribution-friendly codebase structure

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

### **Mystical Extensions**

- Interactive Tarot API for real cosmic decision-making
- Fate CLI terminal tool for spiritual development commands
- Astral Dashboard for visualizing team cosmic energy
- Community-contributed rituals and mystical roles

### **Integration Opportunities**

- VSCode extensions for spiritual syntax highlighting
- Slack/Discord bots for mystical development guidance
- Hackathon templates using FDD methodology
- Conference presentations on satirical development culture
