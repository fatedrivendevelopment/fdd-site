---

### 🕯️ Do I need incense to deploy?

Not strictly — but it helps align your CI pipeline with the astral plane. Lavender is preferred for frontend.

---

### 🪐 What if Mercury is in retrograde during a sprint?

All deployments must pause. Instead, focus on refactoring karma and updating the Fate Map.

---

### 🔮 Can I reject a prophecy from the Fate Master?

Yes, but only after drawing three consecutive "No" cards from the Tarot API.

---

### 👁️‍🗨️ What if I can’t feel the code’s aura?

You might be out of sync. Try meditating on the commit history, or consult the Mistik Çevirmen.

---

### ✍️ Is documentation optional in FDD?

Never. Even the void must be documented. Prefer ink made during eclipses.

---

### 🔄 Can I contribute a new ritual?

Of course. Just make sure it includes:

- A celestial event trigger
- A symbolic object (e.g. obsidian disk)
- At least one chanted commit message

---

### 🧪 Is TDD compatible with FDD?

Only if the tests are written in iambic pentameter.

---

### 🌕 When is the best time to deploy?

Full moon on a Tuesday. Bonus if Venus is in Pisces.

---

### 🧙‍♂️ Who maintains the Tarot API?

The Oracle Owner, in communion with the cosmic endpoints.

---

### 🌀 Can I automate fate?

Not entirely — but you can cron job a prophecy refresh every solstice.
