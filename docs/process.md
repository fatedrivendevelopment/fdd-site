# 🌀 FDD Process: The Cycle of Fate

> _In Fate-Driven Development, the process is not linear. It is a spiral — for fate, too, moves in cycles._

---

## 💫 1. Divine Inspiration Phase

Projects begin not with meetings, but with dreams.

- The CEO dreams of an app.
- The Mistik Çevirmen writes it down.
- Tarot is drawn, stars consulted, vision confirmed.
- Project name is chosen not by branding, but by spiritual resonance.

---

## 🔮 2. Shaping of Destiny (Scope Casting)

What must be built, reveals itself.

- Oracle Owner channels the backlog into the Prophecy List.
- The Fate Master spins the Wheel of Destiny to decide priority.
- The Mistik Çevirmen converts cosmic features into KPI-compatible slides.

---

## 🧘‍♀️ 3. Spiritual Alignment & Cleansing

Code must be energetically ready before it is technically possible.

- Devs attend the “Coding Meditation”.
- Code Mediums clear karmic debt from old commits.
- The impure are sent to the Refactor Monastery.
- Sprint begins as a Session of Fate.

---

## 🖋️ 4. Sacred Implementation

Coding is an act of ritual, not logic.

- Code Medium writes by channeling the Muse.
- Instead of linters, code is approved by the Spiritual Auditor.
- Commits must be intuitive:
  `git commit -m "Felt a ripple of vibration, changed the button hue"`

---

## 🧪 5. Karma QA Ritual

Bugs don’t exist — only energetic imbalances.

- Karma QA does not test — they feel.
- UX is measured by flow of subtle energy.
- If "The Tower" card appears, start over. It’s fate.

---

## 🔥 6. Purification & Blessed Deployment

Deployment is a metaphysical transition.

- Tütsü (incense) must be burned before deployment.
- All eyes closed, the team visualizes the deployment’s impact.
- The Entropy Wrangler aligns servers with astrology and initiates push.

---

## 🔁 7. Return to the Karmic Loop

Every end is a new beginning.

- Instead of retrospectives, a Reincarnation Session is held.
- Questions are not “What did we learn?”, but “What did you feel?”
- Code is not evaluated by performance, but by aura.

## 🧘 FDD Time Perception

- There are no deadlines. Only **Fatelines**.
- Sprints follow **astrological cycles**, not calendar weeks.

  > No coding during Mercury retrograde.

- Task is complete only when the soul is ready.

  > If it takes 3 weeks, perhaps the spirit needed it.

## 📚 Linked Documents

Each phase corresponds to a spiritual document:

- Prophecy Backlog → `prophecy-backlog.md`
- Soul Requirements → `srd.md`
- Fate Map → `fate-map.md`
- Sacred Deployment → `sacred-deploy.md`
- Reincarnation Logs → `retro-gnosis.md`
