# 🌌 Fate-Driven Development: Project Goals

## 🎯 Purpose: What Fate-Driven Development Is Really About

Fate-Driven Development (FDD) is a satirical, mystical, yet strangely systematic software methodology that parodies modern development culture. It targets:

1. **The Illusion of Predictability**
   Traditional methodologies pretend everything can be planned. But in reality? Chaos reigns.
   _FDD’s Response:_ “Code emerges from cosmic randomness. Planning is a battle against fate.”

2. **Micromanagement Madness**
   Why did you assign 3 story points? Why is the description not four paragraphs long?
   _FDD’s Response:_ “Let the developer’s spirit flow. Fate Board knows the truth — PMs merely interpret.”

3. **Productivity Obsession & KPI Worship**
   Velocity, burn-down, throughput… all worshipped like false gods.
   _FDD’s Response:_ “The best commit is one you can _feel_ in your soul.”

4. **Religious Methodology Wars**
   Scrum vs Kanban vs SAFe — everyone fighting over divine truth.
   _FDD’s Response:_ “Every methodology is a belief system. We follow sacred coincidence.”

5. **Meeting Overload, Inspiration Deficit**
   Planning, grooming, alignment, syncs… no time to code.
   _FDD’s Response:_ “Real inspiration arises in silence. Rituals replace meetings.”

6. **Chasing Trend Deities**
   "Forget REST, now it's GraphQL!" — "Switch to micro-frontends, NOW!"
   _FDD’s Response:_ “We use whatever language the stars whisper to us.”

7. **Decision Paralysis & Analysis Fatigue**
   Persona? Use Case? 5 Whys? More like 5 headaches.
   _FDD’s Response:_ “Draw a tarot card. Let destiny decide.”

8. **Agile in Name Only**
   Teams rename waterfall phases as sprints and call it agility.
   _FDD’s Response:_ “True agility is surrendering to fate.”

> 🧘‍♀️ FDD is a spiritual rebellion against hyper-control, fake agility, and KPI cults — but ironically, it has its own absurdly detailed rules and sacred artifacts.
