# ðŸ”® Business Logic Context - Fate-Driven Development

## Core Mission & WHY

Fate-Driven Development (FDD) is a **satirical software methodology** that parodies modern development culture while maintaining genuine structure. The business logic centers on **spiritual rebellion against hyper-control, fake agility, and KPI cults**.

### Primary Business Rules

#### 1. **Satirical + Mystical Balance**

- Content must be absurd but systematic
- Every real-world development pain point gets a mystical counterpart
- Maintains internal consistency within the fictional framework

#### 2. **Parody Targets (WHY each exists)**

- **Scrum â†’ Fate Master rituals**: Mocks ceremony-heavy agile practices
- **Product Backlog â†’ Prophecy Backlog**: Critiques arbitrary prioritization
- **Story Points â†’ Aura Magnitude**: Satirizes estimation obsession
- **Sprint Planning â†’ Tarot Draws**: Highlights randomness in planning
- **Retrospectives â†’ Reincarnation Sessions**: Mocks forced reflection

#### 3. **Tone Enforcement Rules**

- Never break character - treat FDD as legitimately mystical
- Balance comedy with actual development insights
- Use Turkish mystical terms ("IÅŸÄ±kta", "GeÃ§iÅŸte", "GÃ¶lgedeki")
- Mercury retrograde = deployment blocking (consistent mystical logic)

#### 4. **Content Hierarchy Logic**

- **PDR** = source of truth for project direction
- **Manifesto** = core values and satirical principles
- **Roles/Rituals** = organizational structure parody
- **Process** = lifecycle methodology parody
- **Tools** = technology stack mystification

### Target Audience Pain Points

1. **Methodology Wars**: Teams fighting over Scrum vs Kanban vs SAFe
2. **Meeting Overload**: Planning, grooming, alignment, syncs - no time to code
3. **Productivity Obsession**: Velocity, burn-down, throughput worship
4. **Micromanagement**: Why 3 story points? Why not 4 paragraphs in description?
5. **Predictability Illusion**: Everything can be planned (but chaos reigns)
6. **Trend Chasing**: "Forget REST, now GraphQL!" decision fatigue

### Core Value Propositions

- **For Developers**: Humorous commentary on development culture they recognize
- **For Managers**: Mirror to see absurdity of over-process
- **For Teams**: Shared language for discussing methodology problems
- **For Community**: Open-source parody that's actually structured and useful

### Success Metrics (Mystical)

- **Spiritual Resonance**: Do developers feel seen/understood?
- **Karmic Balance**: Does satire illuminate real problems?
- **Cosmic Adoption**: Community contribution and sharing
- **Aura Alignment**: Internal consistency maintained across all content
