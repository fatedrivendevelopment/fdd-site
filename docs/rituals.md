# 🔮 FDD Rituals & Ceremonial Practices

Fate-Driven Development (FDD) sees software development not merely as a technical process but as a ritual, an energy transmission, and a karmic transformation.

In FDD, traditional activities like "daily stand-ups" or "sprint planning" are replaced by mystical ceremonies such as the "Code Purification Rite" or the "Cycle of Fate Opening."

## ✨ 1. Daily Enlightenment Ritual

_(FDD’s version of the Daily Stand-up)_

**How to perform:**

- Begin with 3 minutes of silent meditation.
- Each team member answers:
  1. "What did I notice yesterday?"
  2. "What am I energetically focused on today?"
  3. "Is there any karmic blockage in me?"

Background meditation music is optional. Slack is replaced by inner dialogue.

- Each team member receives a runic symbol.
